In each product's folder, you'll see all of the production firmware alongside a folder titled, "Beta". All of the production versions are considered stable and used for production, whereas the firmware in the "Beta" has not been fully tested and <b>should be used at your own risk</b>. We do our best to test it prior to releasing it, but there may be bugs that we didn't catch. Production firmware is what was put into production and is deemed stable.
